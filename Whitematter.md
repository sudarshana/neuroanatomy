#White matter 

White matter is one of the two main components of the central nervous system, the other being gray matter. The myelin sheath surrounding the axons is what gives white matter its characteristic white color. 

##More:

**Location:** In the brain, white matter is located beneath the cortical gray matter, which contains the cell bodies of neurons. In the spinal cord, white matter surrounds the central gray matter.

**Composition:** White matter is primarily composed of myelinated nerve fibers, which are axons wrapped in a fatty insulating substance called myelin.

**Development:** White matter continues to develop throughout childhood and adolescence, contributing to cognitive and motor skills' maturation. Abnormalities in white matter development can be associated with various neurological conditions.

**Function:** The main function of white matter is to facilitate the rapid transmission of electrical signals between different brain regions and between the brain and the rest of the body. This communication is critical for coordinating various functions, including movement, sensory perception, and cognitive processes.

**Myelin:** The myelin sheath surrounding the axons is what gives white matter its characteristic white color. Myelin acts as an electrical insulator, increasing the speed and efficiency of signal transmission along the nerve fibers.

**Tracts:** White matter is organized into bundles of nerve fibers called tracts. These tracts connect various gray matter areas of the brain to each other and to the spinal cord, enabling communication between brain regions and the rest of the body.

**Plasticity:** White matter demonstrates plasticity, meaning it can adapt and change in response to experience and learning. This is particularly important during brain development and recovery from brain injuries.

**Clinical relevance:** Damage to white matter or the myelin sheath can lead to various neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and certain types of dementia.
