Corpus callosum
/ˈkôrpəs kəˈlōsəm/

The corpus callosum is a thick, C-shaped bundle of neural fibers located in the brain that connects the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

The corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure in the brain, consisting of approximately 200 million axons that facilitate interhemispheric communication and coordination.

**Function:** The primary function of the corpus callosum is to enable communication and integration of information between the two cerebral hemispheres. It allows for the transfer of sensory, motor, and cognitive information, ensuring that both hemispheres work together seamlessly.

**Structure:** The corpus callosum is divided into several distinct regions, each connecting specific areas of the cerebral cortex:
Rostrum: The anterior-most region, connecting the prefrontal cortices.
Genu: The anterior curved region, connecting the prefrontal and premotor cortices.
Body: The central and largest region, connecting the motor, somatosensory, and parietal cortices.
Splenium: The posterior-most region, connecting the occipital, parietal, and temporal cortices.

**Clinical significance:** Abnormalities or damage to the corpus callosum can lead to various neurological conditions, such as:
Agenesis of the corpus callosum: A congenital disorder characterized by the partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum, often associated with developmental delays and cognitive impairments.
Split-brain syndrome: A condition resulting from surgical severing of the corpus callosum (callosotomy) to treat severe epilepsy, leading to a lack of communication between the hemispheres and altered cognitive functioning.
Multiple sclerosis: An autoimmune disorder that can cause demyelination and damage to the corpus callosum, resulting in impaired interhemispheric communication and various neurological symptoms.

**Imaging:** The corpus callosum can be visualized using neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which provide detailed views of its structure and connectivity.
