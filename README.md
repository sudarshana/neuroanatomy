# neuroanatomy

This is a dictionary of neuroanatomy terms. The dictionary is created using multiple AI tools, plus secondary research. 

I am a post-grad Applied Neuroscience student at King's College London. Have hundreds of flash cards, wanted something more permanent. The content is accurate to the best of my knowledge.
